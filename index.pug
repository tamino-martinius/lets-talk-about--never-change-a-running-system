    script(src='node_modules/lets-talk-about--template/main.js')

//- _never change a running system_ as a paradigm in (german) IT for decades
//- and i recently learned that this is a german sentence - or at least mostly germans use that
//- but there is a similar english rule _if it ain't broke, don't fix it_

//- But is that true?
//- Nobody said that we can't try to improve it

//- So i want to talk about Continous improvement today

//- You may have heard that already
//- Continous improvement is an essential part of our scrum methology
